Revision history for VMware::API::LabManager

1.31  2010/07/24

	Provided non-capitalized method names to match Perl style as suggested
         by CPAN rating comments. Historic "Java-style" method names still
	 function.

	Corrected POD and docs for new method names, version changes, other 
	 grammatical errors and removed accidental references to TabFile.pm

	Added initialization checks on exported methods to avoid superfluous
	 warnings generated when -w is used.

	Added credit to PetBlvd (http://www.petblvd.com) for the sponsorship
	 of further development.
